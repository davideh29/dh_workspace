# dh_workspace

This repository has been converted into a basic Python package. The code is located under the `src/` directory and can be installed with standard Python tooling.

## Development

Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests without installing the package by setting `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src pytest
```
